# ⚽ Sports Performance Prediction

🎯 **Goal:** Predict professional football players' market value category (`Low`, `Medium`, `High`) based on performance statistics using Machine Learning.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project uses real-world FIFA player data to build a model that predicts a player's **market value tier** — serving as a proxy for their **sports performance**.

By using supervised classification algorithms, we discover what technical, physical, and mental skills most influence a player’s value. Perfect for scouting, performance evaluation, or analytics dashboards!
